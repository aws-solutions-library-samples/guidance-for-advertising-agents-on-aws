# Negotiation

Not every price is final. When the buyer has Agency or Advertiser tier access, it can negotiate with the seller before committing to a booking. Negotiation sits between inventory research and order execution in the overall buyer workflow --- the agent has already identified what it wants to buy, and now works to get a better price before the deal is booked.

The buyer agent includes a pluggable negotiation module for multi-turn price negotiation with seller agents. You can run fully automatic negotiations or drive them step-by-step.

!!! info "Tier Requirement"
    Only **Agency** and **Advertiser** tier buyers can negotiate. Public and Seat tier buyers cannot — the seller will reject negotiation attempts from those tiers.

## How It Works

```mermaid

    participant Buyer as Buyer Agent
    participant Strategy as NegotiationStrategy
    participant Client as NegotiationClient
    participant Seller as Seller Agent

    Buyer->>Strategy: next_offer() → $20 CPM
    Buyer->>Client: start_negotiation($20)
    Client->>Seller: POST /proposals/{id}/counter {price: 20}
    Seller-->>Client: {seller_price: 32, action: "counter"}
    Client->>Strategy: should_accept($32)?
    Strategy-->>Client: No
    Client->>Strategy: should_walk_away($32)?
    Strategy-->>Client: No
    Client->>Strategy: next_offer($32) → $22
    Client->>Seller: POST /proposals/{id}/counter {price: 22}
    Seller-->>Client: {seller_price: 28, action: "counter"}
    Client->>Strategy: should_accept($28)?
    Strategy-->>Client: Yes (≤ max_cpm $30)
    Client->>Seller: POST /proposals/{id}/counter {action: "accept"}
    Seller-->>Client: Deal confirmed at $28
```

## Strategies

Negotiation behavior is controlled by a **strategy** — a pluggable class that decides when to accept, what to counter, and when to walk away.

### SimpleThresholdStrategy (v1)

The production-ready strategy. Uses fixed thresholds with linear concession steps.

```python
from ad_buyer.negotiation.strategies.simple_threshold import SimpleThresholdStrategy

strategy = SimpleThresholdStrategy(
    target_cpm=20.0,       # Ideal price — our opening offer
    max_cpm=30.0,          # Absolute ceiling — accept anything at or below
    concession_step=2.0,   # Concede $2 per round
    max_rounds=5,          # Walk away after 5 rounds
)
```

**Decision logic:**

| Decision | Rule |
|----------|------|
| **Accept** | Seller price ≤ `max_cpm` |
| **Next offer** | Last offer + `concession_step` (capped at `max_cpm`) |
| **Walk away** | Rounds exceeded `max_rounds` OR seller hasn't moved since last round |

**Behavior profiles:**

| Profile | target_cpm | max_cpm | concession_step | max_rounds | Behavior |
|---------|-----------|---------|-----------------|------------|----------|
| Conservative | $15 | $20 | $1 | 3 | Tight budget, small concessions, quick exit |
| Balanced | $20 | $30 | $2 | 5 | Moderate flexibility |
| Aggressive | $15 | $35 | $5 | 10 | Wide range, big concessions, persistent |

### AdaptiveStrategy

Adjusts concession behavior dynamically based on observed seller patterns --- if the seller is conceding aggressively, the buyer holds firm; if the seller holds firm, the buyer concedes faster to avoid stalemate.

!!! info "Coming Soon"
    AdaptiveStrategy implements the same `NegotiationStrategy` interface and will be a drop-in replacement for `SimpleThresholdStrategy`.

### CompetitiveStrategy

Uses cross-seller intelligence to drive harder bargains when the buyer is shopping multiple sellers simultaneously, leveraging competing quotes as anchor points for negotiation.

!!! info "Coming Soon"
    CompetitiveStrategy requires the [Multi-Seller Orchestration](multi-seller-orchestration.md) capability to provide cross-seller context.

## Auto-Negotiate

The simplest way to negotiate — hand it a strategy and let the client drive the entire loop:

```python
from ad_buyer.negotiation.client import NegotiationClient
from ad_buyer.negotiation.strategies.simple_threshold import SimpleThresholdStrategy

client = NegotiationClient(api_key="your-seller-api-key")

strategy = SimpleThresholdStrategy(
    target_cpm=20.0,
    max_cpm=30.0,
    concession_step=2.0,
    max_rounds=5,
)

result = await client.auto_negotiate(
    seller_url="http://seller.example.com:8001",
    proposal_id="prop-abc123",
    strategy=strategy,
)

print(f"Outcome: {result.outcome}")       # "accepted" or "walked_away"
print(f"Final price: ${result.final_price}")  # e.g. 28.0
print(f"Rounds: {result.rounds_count}")    # e.g. 3
```

The `auto_negotiate` loop:

1. Calls `strategy.next_offer()` for the opening price
2. Sends counter-offer to seller's `/proposals/{id}/counter`
3. Checks `strategy.should_accept()` — if yes, accepts and returns
4. Checks `strategy.should_walk_away()` — if yes, declines and returns
5. Otherwise, computes `strategy.next_offer()` and loops back to step 2

## Manual Step-by-Step

For more control, drive the negotiation round by round:

```python
from ad_buyer.negotiation.client import NegotiationClient
from ad_buyer.negotiation.strategies.simple_threshold import SimpleThresholdStrategy

client = NegotiationClient(api_key="your-seller-api-key")
strategy = SimpleThresholdStrategy(target_cpm=20, max_cpm=30, concession_step=2, max_rounds=5)

# Start with our opening offer
session = await client.start_negotiation(
    seller_url="http://seller.example.com:8001",
    proposal_id="prop-abc123",
    initial_price=20.0,
    strategy=strategy,
)

print(f"Seller countered at: ${session.current_seller_price}")

# Send our counter-offer
round_2 = await client.counter_offer(session, price=22.0)
print(f"Seller response: ${round_2.seller_price} ({round_2.action})")

# Accept or continue
if round_2.action == "accept" or round_2.seller_price <= 30.0:
    confirmation = await client.accept(session)
    print("Deal accepted!")
else:
    await client.decline(session)
    print("Walked away.")
```

## Writing a Custom Strategy

Implement the `NegotiationStrategy` ABC to create any negotiation behavior:

```python
from ad_buyer.negotiation.strategy import NegotiationStrategy, NegotiationContext

class MyCustomStrategy(NegotiationStrategy):
    def should_accept(self, seller_price: float, context: NegotiationContext) -> bool:
        """Accept if seller's price is acceptable."""
        return seller_price <= 25.0

    def next_offer(self, seller_price: float, context: NegotiationContext) -> float:
        """Calculate our next counter-offer."""
        if context.our_last_offer is None:
            return 18.0  # Opening offer
        # Split the difference
        return (context.our_last_offer + seller_price) / 2

    def should_walk_away(self, seller_price: float, context: NegotiationContext) -> bool:
        """Walk away after 3 rounds or if seller isn't budging."""
        if context.rounds_completed >= 3:
            return True
        if (context.seller_previous_price is not None
                and seller_price >= context.seller_previous_price):
            return True  # Seller isn't moving
        return False
```

The `NegotiationContext` provides:

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `rounds_completed` | `int` | Number of rounds so far |
| `seller_last_price` | `float` | Seller's most recent price |
| `our_last_offer` | `float?` | Our most recent counter (None for first round) |
| `seller_previous_price` | `float?` | Seller's price from the round before last |
| `started_at` | `datetime` | When the negotiation started |

## Reference: Data Models

### NegotiationResult

Returned by `auto_negotiate()`:

```python
class NegotiationResult:
    proposal_id: str
    outcome: NegotiationOutcome  # "accepted", "walked_away", "declined", "error"
    final_price: Optional[float]  # None if walked away
    rounds_count: int
    rounds: list[NegotiationRound]
    completed_at: datetime
```

### NegotiationRound

Each round in the negotiation history:

```python
class NegotiationRound:
    round_number: int
    buyer_price: float       # What we offered
    seller_price: float      # What the seller countered
    action: str              # "counter", "accept", "reject", "final_offer"
    rationale: str           # Seller's explanation (if provided)
    timestamp: datetime
```

### NegotiationSession

Tracks an active negotiation (used in manual mode):

```python
class NegotiationSession:
    proposal_id: str
    seller_url: str
    negotiation_id: str
    current_seller_price: float
    our_last_offer: Optional[float]
    rounds: list[NegotiationRound]
    started_at: datetime
```

## Seller-Side Integration

The buyer's `NegotiationClient` communicates with the seller's negotiation endpoints:

| Action | HTTP Call |
|--------|-----------|
| Counter-offer | `POST /proposals/{id}/counter` with `{price: float}` |
| Accept | `POST /proposals/{id}/counter` with `{price: float, action: "accept"}` |
| Decline | `POST /proposals/{id}/counter` with `{action: "decline"}` |

The seller's negotiation engine responds with its own strategy (AGGRESSIVE, STANDARD, COLLABORATIVE, or PREMIUM depending on the buyer's tier). See the [Seller Negotiation Protocol](https://iabtechlab.github.io/seller-agent/integration/negotiation/) for the seller-side view.

## Negotiation Eligibility

Whether a buyer can negotiate depends on its access tier:

| Tier | Can Negotiate | How |
|------|:---:|------|
| PUBLIC | No | — |
| SEAT | No | — |
| AGENCY | Yes | Reveal `agency_id` via identity headers |
| ADVERTISER | Yes | Reveal `advertiser_id` via identity headers |

Check programmatically:

```python
from ad_buyer.models.buyer_identity import BuyerContext

if buyer_context.can_negotiate():
    result = await client.auto_negotiate(seller_url, proposal_id, strategy)
```
