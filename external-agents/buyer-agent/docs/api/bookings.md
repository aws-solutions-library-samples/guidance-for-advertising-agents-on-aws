# Bookings API

A **booking** is the buyer agent's end-to-end process of turning a campaign brief into confirmed advertising deals. You submit a brief describing your campaign objectives, budget, audience, and timeline; the buyer agent allocates budget across channels, researches inventory from connected sellers, optionally negotiates pricing, and presents recommendations for your approval. Once approved, the agent books confirmed line items via the seller's OpenDirect API. Use these endpoints to start a booking, poll its progress, and approve or reject the resulting recommendations.

The bookings endpoints manage the full campaign booking lifecycle --- from brief submission through approval to deal execution.

## Status Lifecycle

```
pending --> running --> awaiting_approval --> completed
                                         \-> failed
                   \-> failed
```

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `pending` | Job created, background flow starting |
| `running` | Budget allocation, inventory research, and negotiation (if eligible) in progress |
| `awaiting_approval` | Recommendations ready for human review |
| `completed` | Deals booked (or no recommendations approved) |
| `failed` | An error occurred during the flow |

!!! info "Negotiation During the Running Phase"
    During the `running` phase, the buyer agent may negotiate pricing with the seller for eligible buyer tiers (Agency and Advertiser). The `kpis.target_cpm` field in the campaign brief can drive negotiation behavior by setting the buyer's target price. See the [Negotiation Guide](../guides/negotiation.md) for details.

## Error Handling

All booking endpoints return structured error responses with an HTTP status code and a JSON body containing `error` and `detail` fields.

```json
{
  "error": "not_found",
  "detail": "Booking job a1b2c3d4-... not found"
}
```

### Error Codes

| Endpoint | HTTP Status | `error` | When |
|----------|------------|---------|------|
| `POST /bookings` | `400` | `invalid_brief` | Required brief fields missing or invalid (e.g., budget <= 0, empty objectives, end_date before start_date) |
| `POST /bookings` | `422` | `validation_error` | Brief payload fails Pydantic schema validation |
| `GET /bookings/{job_id}` | `404` | `not_found` | No booking job exists with the given ID |
| `POST /bookings/{job_id}/approve` | `404` | `not_found` | No booking job exists with the given ID |
| `POST /bookings/{job_id}/approve` | `409` | `invalid_status` | Job is not in `awaiting_approval` status |
| `POST /bookings/{job_id}/approve` | `400` | `invalid_products` | None of the submitted product IDs match pending recommendations |
| `POST /bookings/{job_id}/approve-all` | `404` | `not_found` | No booking job exists with the given ID |
| `POST /bookings/{job_id}/approve-all` | `409` | `invalid_status` | Job is not in `awaiting_approval` status |
| `GET /bookings` | `422` | `validation_error` | Invalid query parameter value (e.g., non-integer `limit`) |
| *any* | `500` | `internal_error` | Unexpected server error during booking flow execution |

### Booking Flow Failures

When the background booking flow fails (seller unreachable, budget allocation error, etc.), the job transitions to `failed` status rather than returning an HTTP error. Poll `GET /bookings/{job_id}` and check the `errors` array:

```json
{
  "job_id": "a1b2c3d4-...",
  "status": "failed",
  "errors": [
    "Seller agent unreachable at http://seller:8001",
    "Budget allocation failed: no valid channel splits found"
  ]
}
```
