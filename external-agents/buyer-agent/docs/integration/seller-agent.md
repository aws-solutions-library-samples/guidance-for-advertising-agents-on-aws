# Seller Agent Integration

The buyer agent does not operate in isolation --- it needs at least one seller agent to provide advertising inventory. This page explains how to configure the buyer to connect to a seller, what API calls flow between them during a booking, and how authentication and multi-seller discovery work. If you are setting up the buyer for the first time, start with the [Quickstart](../getting-started/quickstart.md) and return here when you are ready to customize the seller connection.

The buyer agent connects to one or more seller agents to search inventory, check availability, negotiate pricing, and book deals using the IAB [OpenDirect](https://iabtechlab.com/standards/opendirect/) 2.1 protocol.

## Connection Configuration

The `OpenDirectClient` is configured through environment variables:

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `OPENDIRECT_BASE_URL` | Base URL of the seller's OpenDirect API | `http://localhost:3000/api/v2.1` |
| `OPENDIRECT_TOKEN` | OAuth 2.0 bearer token for seller auth | (none) |
| `OPENDIRECT_API_KEY` | API key for seller auth (fallback if no token) | (none) |

The client is instantiated in `interfaces/api/main.py`:

```python
OpenDirectClient(
    base_url=settings.opendirect_base_url,
    oauth_token=settings.opendirect_token,
    api_key=settings.opendirect_api_key,
)
```

### Authentication Priority

The client sets headers in this order:

1. If `oauth_token` is provided: `Authorization: Bearer <token>`
2. Else if `api_key` is provided: `X-API-Key: <key>`
3. Otherwise: no authentication header

### Multi-Seller Mode

For connecting to multiple seller agents, use the `SELLER_ENDPOINTS` setting (comma-separated URLs):

```dotenv
SELLER_ENDPOINTS=https://seller-a.example.com/api/v2.1,https://seller-b.example.com/api/v2.1
```

Parse with `settings.get_seller_endpoints()`.

## Discovery

Seller agents may expose a well-known discovery endpoint:

```
GET <seller-base>/.well-known/agent.json
```

This returns the seller's capabilities, supported OpenDirect version, and available endpoints. The buyer agent can use this to verify compatibility before starting a booking flow.

## Main Integration Points

### Product Search

The buyer queries the seller's product catalog during the research phase:

- **List products**: `GET /products?$skip=0&$top=50` --- paginated product listing
- **Search products**: `POST /products/search` --- filtered search with channel, format, pricing criteria
- **Get product**: `GET /products/{id}` --- single product details

### Availability and Pricing

Before recommending products, channel specialists check availability:

- **Check avails**: `POST /products/avails` --- returns available impressions, estimated CPM, total cost, and delivery confidence

### Negotiation

For eligible buyer tiers (Agency and Advertiser), the buyer can negotiate pricing with the seller before booking:

- **Start negotiation**: Via `NegotiationClient`, the buyer submits a counter-offer on a seller's proposal
- **Multi-turn**: The buyer and seller exchange offers until agreement or walk-away
- **Auto or manual**: Negotiations can run fully automatically using a pluggable `NegotiationStrategy`, or step-by-step

See the [Negotiation Guide](../guides/negotiation.md) for configuration and strategy details.

### Order and Line Management

After approval, the buyer creates orders and books line items:

- **Create order**: `POST /accounts/{id}/orders` --- creates an insertion order
- **Create line**: `POST /accounts/{id}/orders/{id}/lines` --- creates a line item for a product
- **Reserve line**: `PATCH /accounts/{id}/orders/{id}/lines/{id}?action=reserve` --- reserves inventory
- **Book line**: `PATCH /accounts/{id}/orders/{id}/lines/{id}?action=book` --- confirms the booking

### Performance Monitoring

For in-flight campaigns:

- **Line stats**: `GET /accounts/{id}/orders/{id}/lines/{id}/stats` --- delivery metrics, pacing, spend
