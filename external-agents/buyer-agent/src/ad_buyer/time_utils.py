"""Time / datetime helpers.

`utc_now()` replaces the deprecated `datetime.utcnow()` (Python 3.12+)
while preserving the existing project-wide convention of NAIVE-UTC
timestamps. Per ar-4e9b: `datetime.utcnow()` is on a deprecation path
in Python 3.12+; the recommended `datetime.now(datetime.UTC)` returns
a TZ-AWARE value, which is semantically correct but would require
synchronized changes across every comparator and every test that
expects naive UTC.

`utc_now()` returns the AWARE UTC datetime stripped of its tzinfo,
giving callers exactly what `datetime.utcnow()` used to return without
the deprecation warning.
