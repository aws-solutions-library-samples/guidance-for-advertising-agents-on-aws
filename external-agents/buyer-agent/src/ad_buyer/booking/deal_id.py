"""Deal ID generation utility.

Extracts the deal ID generation logic previously duplicated in:
- unified_client.py (request_deal method)
- tools/buyer_deals/request_deal.py (_generate_deal_id method)

Deal IDs have the format: DEAL-XXXXXXXX
where XXXXXXXX is 8 uppercase hex characters derived from
a secrets-based token seeded with the product ID, identity, and timestamp.
