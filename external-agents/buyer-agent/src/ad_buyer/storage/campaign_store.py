"""SQLite-backed campaign state persistence.

Provides CRUD operations for the campaign automation data model:
- campaigns: Core campaign records with status, brief, budget, flight dates
- pacing_snapshots: Periodic pacing data points per campaign
- creative_assets: Creative files and metadata per campaign
- ad_server_campaigns: Ad server integration records (Innovid/Flashtalking)
- campaign_events: Lifecycle events emitted during state transitions
- approval_requests: Human approval gate requests (buyer-2qs)

Integrates with CampaignAutomationStateMachine (buyer-0u9) to validate
all status transitions before persisting them.  Lifecycle convenience
methods (create_campaign, start_planning, start_booking, mark_ready,
activate_campaign, pause_campaign, resume_campaign, complete_campaign,
cancel_campaign) combine validation, DB update, and event emission.

Thread safety is provided by check_same_thread=False and a threading.Lock(),
matching the DealStore pattern.
