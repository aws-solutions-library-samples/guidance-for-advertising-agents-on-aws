# Change Requests

Change requests handle post-deal modifications to orders. Each request is validated against the current order state, assigned a severity level, and routed through the appropriate approval path.

## Severity Levels

Severity is auto-classified based on change type and magnitude:

| Severity | Approval | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `minor` | Auto-approved | Low-impact changes (e.g., creative swap, flight date shift of 3 days or less) |
| `material` | Human review required | Significant changes (e.g., impression adjustment, targeting change) |
| `critical` | Senior review required | High-impact changes (e.g., pricing change >20%, cancellation) |

### Default Severity by Change Type

| Change Type | Default Severity | Notes |
|-------------|-----------------|-------|
| `flight_dates` | `material` | Downgraded to `minor` if shift is 3 days or less |
| `impressions` | `material` | |
| `pricing` | `critical` | Upgraded to `critical` if price change >20% |
| `creative` | `minor` | Auto-approved |
| `targeting` | `material` | |
| `cancellation` | `critical` | |
| `other` | `material` | |

## Create a Change Request

**POST** `/api/v1/change-requests`

### Request Body

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `order_id` | string | Yes | The order to modify |
| `change_type` | string | Yes | One of: `flight_dates`, `impressions`, `pricing`, `creative`, `targeting`, `cancellation`, `other` |
| `diffs` | array | No | List of field-level changes: `{field, old_value, new_value}` |
| `proposed_values` | object | No | Key-value pairs of proposed new values |
| `reason` | string | No | Explanation for the change |
| `requested_by` | string | No | Who requested (default: `system`) |

### Example: Shift Flight Dates (Minor --- Auto-Approved)

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/change-requests \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "order_id": "ORD-A1B2C3D4E5F6",
    "change_type": "flight_dates",
    "diffs": [
      {"field": "flight_start", "old_value": "2026-04-01", "new_value": "2026-04-03"},
      {"field": "flight_end", "old_value": "2026-04-30", "new_value": "2026-05-02"}
    ],
    "reason": "Campaign launch delayed by 2 days",
    "requested_by": "agent:buyer-001"
  }'
```

Because the date shift is 2 days (within the 3-day threshold), this is classified as `minor` and auto-approved.

### Example: Modify Pricing (Critical --- Requires Review)

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/change-requests \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "order_id": "ORD-A1B2C3D4E5F6",
    "change_type": "pricing",
    "diffs": [
      {"field": "final_cpm", "old_value": 10.00, "new_value": 8.50}
    ],
    "proposed_values": {"final_cpm": 8.50},
    "reason": "Buyer requested discount after volume commitment",
    "requested_by": "human:ops-jane"
  }'
```

This is classified as `critical` (pricing change of 15%) and enters `pending_approval` status.

### Validation Errors (422)

The system validates change requests against the current order state:

- Cannot modify orders in `completed`, `cancelled`, or `failed` status
- Cancellation is only allowed from active states (`draft`, `submitted`, `pending_approval`, `approved`, `in_progress`, `booked`)
- Impression changes must be positive integers

Failed validation returns HTTP 422 with the change request ID and error list.

## Review a Change Request

**POST** `/api/v1/change-requests/{cr_id}/review`

## Change Request Lifecycle

See [Change Request Flow](../state-machines/change-request-flow.md) for the full state diagram.

1. **pending** --- Created, awaiting validation
2. **validating** --- Being validated against order state
3. **pending_approval** --- Material/critical changes awaiting human review
4. **approved** --- Approved (auto or manual), ready to apply
5. **rejected** --- Rejected by reviewer
6. **applied** --- Changes applied to the order
7. **failed** --- Validation failed
