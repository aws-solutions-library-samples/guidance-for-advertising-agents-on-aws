# Approval & Human-in-the-Loop

The seller agent supports human-in-the-loop approval gates that let publisher
operators review and approve (or reject) automated decisions before they are
finalized. This is critical for high-value deals or when operator oversight is
required.

---

## How Approval Works

### Enable Approval

Set these environment variables:

```bash
APPROVAL_GATE_ENABLED=true
EVENT_BUS_ENABLED=true    # Required -- approvals use the event bus
APPROVAL_TIMEOUT_HOURS=24  # Hours before a pending approval expires
APPROVAL_REQUIRED_FLOWS=proposal_decision  # Comma-separated gate names
```

### The Approval Lifecycle

```mermaid

    participant Buyer as Buyer Agent
    participant API as Seller API
    participant Flow as ProposalFlow
    participant Crew as CrewAI Agents
    participant Gate as ApprovalGate
    participant Store as Storage
    participant Op as Publisher Operator

    Buyer->>API: POST /proposals
    API->>Flow: Evaluate proposal
    Flow->>Crew: Run proposal review
    Crew->>Flow: Recommend accept/counter/reject
    Flow->>Gate: request_approval(context, state snapshot)
    Gate->>Store: Store ApprovalRequest (status=pending)
    Gate-->>API: Return pending_approval
    API-->>Buyer: {"status": "pending_approval", "approval_id": "..."}

    Note over Op,Store: Flow PAUSES here

    Op->>API: GET /approvals
    API-->>Op: List of pending approvals with context

    Op->>API: POST /approvals/{id}/decide
    Note right of Op: approve / reject / counter
    API->>Gate: submit_decision(...)
    Gate->>Store: Update status, store response

    Op->>API: POST /approvals/{id}/resume
    API->>Flow: Re-hydrate from state snapshot
    Flow->>Flow: Apply human decision
    Flow-->>API: Final result
    API-->>Buyer: Final proposal response
```

### Key Design Decision

Since CrewAI flows run to completion and cannot truly pause mid-execution, the
approval pattern works by:

1. Completing the crew evaluation and capturing a **flow state snapshot**
2. Storing the snapshot alongside the approval request
3. On resume, re-hydrating the flow state from the snapshot and applying the
   human decision -- **no expensive re-computation needed**

## API Endpoints

### List Pending Approvals

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/approvals
```

Response:

```json
{
  "approvals": [
    {
      "approval_id": "apr-abc12345",
      "flow_id": "flow-xyz",
      "flow_type": "proposal_handling",
      "gate_name": "proposal_decision",
      "proposal_id": "prop-123",
      "status": "pending",
      "expires_at": "2026-03-11T14:30:00Z",
      "context": {
        "recommendation": "accept",
        "buyer_name": "MediaBuy Corp",
        "product": "CTV Premium Streaming",
        "proposed_cpm": 32.50,
        "deal_value": 162500.00
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Get Approval Details

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/approvals/{approval_id}
```

Response includes both the request and the response (if decided):

```json
{
  "request": {
    "approval_id": "apr-abc12345",
    "flow_id": "flow-xyz",
    "flow_type": "proposal_handling",
    "gate_name": "proposal_decision",
    "status": "pending",
    "context": { "..." : "..." }
  },
  "response": null
}
```

### Submit a Decision

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/approvals/{approval_id}/decide \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "decision": "approve",
    "decided_by": "jane@publisher.com",
    "reason": "Deal value within acceptable range"
  }'
```

Valid `decision` values:

| Decision | Effect |
|----------|--------|
| `"approve"` | Accept the crew's recommendation as-is |
| `"reject"` | Reject the proposal outright |
| `"counter"` | Modify terms before finalizing (use `modifications` field) |

Counter example with modifications:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/approvals/{approval_id}/decide \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "decision": "counter",
    "decided_by": "jane@publisher.com",
    "reason": "Floor too low for this inventory",
    "modifications": {
      "counter_cpm": 38.00,
      "counter_terms": "Minimum 2M impressions required"
    }
  }'
```

### Resume the Flow

After submitting a decision, resume the flow to generate the final result:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/approvals/{approval_id}/resume
```

This re-hydrates the flow state from the snapshot, applies the human decision,
and returns the final proposal response to the caller.

!!! warning "Order of Operations"
    You must call `/decide` before `/resume`. Calling `/resume` on a still-pending
    approval returns a 400 error: `"Approval has not been decided yet. Call /decide first."`

---

## Timeout Behavior

Approvals expire after `APPROVAL_TIMEOUT_HOURS` (default: 24 hours). When an
expired approval is accessed:

- The status is automatically updated to `timed_out`
- Attempting to submit a decision on an expired approval returns a 400 error
- Expired approvals are filtered out of the `GET /approvals` pending list

---

## Configuring Which Flows Require Approval

The `APPROVAL_REQUIRED_FLOWS` setting is a comma-separated list of gate names.
Currently supported:

| Gate Name | Flow | When Triggered |
|-----------|------|---------------|
| `proposal_decision` | ProposalHandlingFlow | After crew evaluates a buyer proposal and recommends accept/counter/reject |

Example:

```bash
APPROVAL_REQUIRED_FLOWS=proposal_decision
```

When approval is not enabled (or the gate name is not in the list), the crew's
recommendation is applied automatically without operator review.

---

## Event Bus Integration

Approval events are published to the event bus when enabled:

| Event Type | When |
|-----------|------|
| `APPROVAL_REQUESTED` | A new approval request is created |
| `APPROVAL_GRANTED` | Operator approves |
| `APPROVAL_DENIED` | Operator rejects |

You can monitor these via `GET /events`.

## Current Limitations

!!! note "Planned Improvements"
    The approval system currently supports:

    - Proposal accept/counter/reject approval

    Planned features:

    - Approval rules engine (auto-trigger based on deal value, buyer tier, deal type)
    - Role-based routing (ops, legal, finance)
    - Deal registration approval gate
    - Order activation approval gate
    - Conditional auto-approve (e.g., auto-approve if deal value < $10K)

    See [PROGRESS.md](https://github.com/IABTechLab/seller-agent/blob/main/.beads/PROGRESS.md) for roadmap status.
    - Approval dashboard UI
    - Webhook notifications for pending approvals
    - Slack / email integration for approval alerts
    - Approval SLA tracking and escalation
