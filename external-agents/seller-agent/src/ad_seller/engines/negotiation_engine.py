"""Negotiation Engine - Multi-round buyer-seller negotiation.

Stateless engine that evaluates buyer offers and generates counter-proposals
using strategy-per-buyer-tier, concession tracking, and walk-away logic.
All state is externalized via NegotiationHistory.

Composes PricingRulesEngine (for tier-adjusted base prices) and
YieldOptimizer (for yield scoring). No duplicated pricing logic.
